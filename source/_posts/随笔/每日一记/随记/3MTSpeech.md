# Disappearance of The DAO

Can you imagine a big internet organization disappearing in three months?  And its property are worth **billions** of dollars?

When I learned about this history, I was very surprised, so I want to know what happend?.

## Context:

### 1. What is The DAO? 什么是The DAO

DAO is Decentralized Autonomous Organization，It's an organization built on Ethereum, Ethereum is the application of blockchain technology.

What is blockchain? What is Ethereum? What is decentralization?

Don't worry, a small example will tell you a lot about them.

In general, our central bank is responsible for issuing and managing money

but under blockchain technology, each of us can be a part of the world.

We don't need a central bank to take care of that anymore.

everyone has a small blackboard to keep track of the transactions that happen around them.

Wait our recorded over, We started talking about.and then we choose a representative.

Show his blackboard, everyone made sure he didn't make any mistakes and copied his words in his blackboard.

In the end , We reach a consensus.

If there is nothing about you on this record,Don't worry, This process is iterative, and you'll get another chance next time.

Each time we connect the blackboard together we form what's called a **"blockchain"** ,And blockchain is unique.

This is a simple little example, Of course, this requires some distributed consensus algorithm and data encryption.We don't care about these details.

Each connected person builds a "net" to defend against external attacks, similar to an ant colony.The advantage of this model is that it is very safe and cant modify and other.

For centralised Banks:

We can record many transfer transactions on the blackboard, share the bank's business.  This is called **decentralization**

BitCoin and  **Ethereum** is a virtual currency in this mode But **Ethereum** board can record not only transactions but also calculations, like this a plus b equal c.We call its function.

A number of functions make up an **smart contract**

Add the blockchain smart contract, the blockchain becomes the global computer, and it can do a lot more things.

DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that relies on Ethereum to achieve its decentralization

 **The DAO** is one of DAO,and its biggest.

## Purpose: 

I hope to find out what is The reason for The three months from prosperity to decline of The DAO

 I decided to collect relevant information on the Internet and look for videos or articles to read.

After listening to The block chain open course of Xiao Zhen, a teacher from Peking University, I figured out The gap of The DAO being hacked

## Method:

 In May 2016, The DAO released its crowd-funding smart contract to Ethereum.

Just a month later, TheDAO had raised hundreds of millions of dollars.That's 15% of the total Ethereum currency.

Coincidentally, the problem also lies in this smart contract.

 I learned the main source content of the deployment, and the vulnerability appeared in three lines of code.

Hackers used Re-entrancy Attack to attack the code here

The general process of the attack

After voting, The DAO will return ethereal to each user

For the average user, the function that the user is calling ends

But for The hacker, they call The DAO's reward function in their callback

So hackers were able to keep stealing TheDAO's total money

It's easy to modify right, just need to put the third line first

But such modifications are very hard to make on a blockchain

Because we have consensus in the past , everyone already has this code on their own blackboard, And this board is in the past.

To modify it, you need to modify everybody

Although the worker of The DAO proposed some solutions, but they ultimately failed.

After September, The DAO gradually withdrew from people's view

## Results:

 We can learn a lot from The DAO

first, We need to do more testing when we write smart contracts to the blockchain 

Because once it's in the block, your code is visible to everyone, and everyone can use it.You basically can't change it

The second, smart contract is anyting but smart,because it just is code,It cannot be executed automatically.

In the end ,Irrevocability(不可篡改性) is a double edged sword, don't think blockchain is very good.Your data needs to fit into blockchain storage

## Discussion:

Now do you see what decentralisation really means?

Both centralization and decentralization have appropriate scenarios, so you need to adapt the working method to local conditions.

That's all I have to say, Thank you.
